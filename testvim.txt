if there is no such file after vim instruction, vim will creat a file for you,
and this file is so created.

.swp .swo .un files are created when using vim editor to recover files closed
accidentally

i to insert before cursor
a to insert behind cursor
o to insert at the head of next line
# o is fantastic^^

capital I is going to the beginning of the current line
capital A is going to the end of the current line
capital O is going to the head of the above line that will be created.

:q quit without saving
:wq quit kept saving
:!q quit without saving

use number + arrow to move quickly
eg: 5 + j is going to move the cursor 5 line down

:set number  # set the left side number for coding
:set relative number # set the left side number of relation (this is insane
useful when quickly moving to a specific line)
:set mouse=a  # this activate your mouse in vim 

you can save you preferences in ~/.vimrc file using 
the file .vimrc is located in C:/Users/youraccountname
